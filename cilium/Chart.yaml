description: A Helm chart for cilium

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time a new bundle is released and
# should match the InstallationBundle version
version: 1.0.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be incremented each time a new bundle is released and
# should match the InstallationBundle version. Each patch done should result in the build number increased.
